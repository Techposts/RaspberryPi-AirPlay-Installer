###  üöÄ Quick Start Installation

After installing Raspberry Pi OS Lite and connecting to your Pi via SSH, run this single command. It will download the pre-check script and, if successful, automatically launch the main installer.

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Techposts/RaspberryPi-AirPlay-Installer/main/RaspberryPi-AirPlay-Installer-Scripts/pre_check_airplay_on_pi.sh | bash
curl -sSl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Techposts/RaspberryPi-AirPlay-Installer/main/RaspberryPi-AirPlay-Installer-Scripts/install_airplay_v3.sh | bash
```

The script is interactive and will guide you through the process. Once finished, it will reboot, and your AirPlay 2 receiver will be ready to use!

### ‚úÖ The Final Result

When you're done, your setup will be seamless. Your Raspberry Pi will appear as a native AirPlay device on your network, ready to stream from any Apple device.

### How It Works

This project uses a two-script system for a safe and reliable installation:

1.  **`pre_check_airplay_on_pi.sh`:** A non-invasive script that checks your system for common issues without making any changes. If all checks pass, it automatically downloads and runs the main installer.
2.  **`install_airplay_v3.sh`:** The powerful main installer that performs all the required actions to build and configure the AirPlay 2 software (`Shairport-Sync` and `nqptp`).
